## Capstone Proposal

#### What is the problem you want to solve?
Predict which customers of a website will become repeat buyers in order to increase Customer Lifetime Value.

#### Who is your client and why do they care about this problem?
Client is an ecommerce retailer who would like to decrease overall customer acquisition cost.

#### What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?
Kaggle data will be used from https://www.kaggle.com/c/acquire-valued-shoppers-challenge

#### In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem
After clean up of raw data, I will attempt to use the [XDA package](https://github.com/ujjwalkarn/xda/blob/master/README.md) for exploratory data analysis. Following this a best-fit multiple linear regression model will be created.

#### What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.
R code, visualizations using ggplot2 and [ggthemes](https://github.com/jrnold/ggthemes), statistical model design, prediction with test data and Data Story via slide deck.
